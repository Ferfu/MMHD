# MMHD
WIP textures for MM intended for the GlideN64 plugin. Please make sure to follow all of the instructions and to use 7-zip to extract the pack. 

The HTS version has the lowest hardware requirements and will only use several hundred mb of RAM. It is the only version that will load in current Project64 releases.

The HTC version loads all textures at startup and should eliminate stuttering, but consumes too much memory to be used with a 32-bit emulator like Project64. It is only for those using Mupen64 or experimental x64 versions of Project64 (which also require a x64 GlideN64 build). 

The PNG version contains the raw image files and will take much longer to load. It is only recommended for those who want to build their own cache files.
