# MMHD
High resolution textures to be used with either the Zelda64Recompiled port or GlideN64 plugin. Project64 is no longer recommended due to severe technical issues with the emulator, please use RMG instead: https://github.com/Rosalie241/RMG/releases/latest

Thanks to these contributors:
GhostlyDark for fixes and regional variations
Skilar for 3D model references
Tom Garden for the Gerudo pirate poster
