# MMHD
High resolution textures for MM to be used with either the Recompiled port (recommended), 2ship port, or GlideN64 plugin. Please make sure to use 7-zip to extract the archives. 

Project64 is no longer support due to severe technical issues with the emulator, please use RMG instead: https://github.com/Rosalie241/RMG/releases/latest

Thanks to these contributors:
GhostlyDark for fixes and regional variations
Skilar for 3D model references
Tom Garden for the Gerudo pirate poster
